# 🚀 End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end data engineering workflow** that takes raw CSV data as input, processes and transforms it using Python, stores it in a SQLite data warehouse, and generates analytical outputs using SQL.

The focus of this project is to showcase **how raw business data is converted into analytics-ready insights**, following real-world data engineering practices.

---

## 🧾 Input Data (What Goes In)

The pipeline starts with **raw CSV files** that simulate data from an e-commerce system.

### Input Files:
- **customers.csv**
  - customer_id
  - customer_name
  - email
  - city
  - signup_date

- **products.csv**
  - product_id
  - product_name
  - category
  - price

- **orders.csv**
  - order_id
  - customer_id
  - product_id
  - quantity
  - order_date

These files are placed inside the `data/raw/` directory.

---

## 🔄 Processing Logic (What Happens in Between)

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Python scripts read the raw CSV files.
- Data is loaded into memory using Pandas.

### 2️⃣ Data Transformation
The following transformations are applied:
- Column names are standardized
- Missing or invalid values are handled
- Data types (dates, numbers) are corrected
- Clean, analytics-ready CSV files are created

➡️ Output of this step is saved in `data/clean/`

---

### 3️⃣ Data Loading
- Cleaned CSV files are loaded into a **SQLite database (`warehouse.db`)**
- Tables created:
  - `customers`
  - `products`
  - `orders`
- Data is inserted using Python (`pandas.to_sql()`)

This step converts flat files into a **structured relational data warehouse**.

---

## 📊 Analytics Layer (What Query Is Run)

Once data is loaded into SQLite, analytical queries are executed to answer business questions such as:

### 🔹 Business Question 1  
**Which products generate the highest revenue?**

- Revenue is calculated using:
quantity × product price

yaml
Copy code
- Orders are joined with products
- Revenue is aggregated per product

---

### 🔹 Business Question 2  
**Who are the top customers based on number of orders?**

- Orders are joined with customers
- Orders are counted per customer
- Customers are ranked by order volume

---

## 📈 Output (What Comes Out)

### ✅ Output 1: Product Revenue Report
A ranked table showing:
- Product name
- Total revenue generated by each product

Example output:
Laptop → ₹165,000
Mobile → ₹100,000
Tablet → ₹50,000
Monitor → ₹48,000

yaml
Copy code

---

### ✅ Output 2: Customer Order Summary
A ranked table showing:
- Customer identifier (email)
- Total number of orders placed

Example output:
amit@gmail.com → 2 orders
ankit@gmail.com → 2 orders
divya@gmail.com → 2 orders

yaml
Copy code

## ▶️ How to Run the Pipeline

### Step 1: Transform Raw Data
```bash
python transformation/transform.py
Step 2: Load Data into SQLite
bash
Copy code
python sql/warehouse/load_to_sqlite.py
Step 3: Run Analytics
Open analytics.sql in VS Code

Right-click → Run Query

View results in SQLite Explorer

🎯 Key Outcomes
Raw CSV data converted into a relational warehouse

Clean separation of ingestion, transformation, and analytics

SQL used for real business insights

End-to-end pipeline suitable for production-style workflows
